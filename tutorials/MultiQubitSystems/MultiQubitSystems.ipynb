In big-endian format, the *most significant* bits come first. For example: $110_2 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 4 + 2 = 6$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> There is an alternate way of writing binary numbers - **little-endian format**. In little-endian format, the *least significant* bits come first. For example, $2$ would be written as $01$, $4$ as $001$, and $6$ as $011$. To put it another way, in little endian format, the number is written backwards compared to the big-endian format.\n",
